# equivariant_hgn
Anonymous repository for Equivariant Heterogenous Graph Networks â€“ ICLR 2022

To run, first download data by following instructions in `data/LP` and `data/NC`.
Code may be run by running `run.py` in the `equivariant_hgn/scripts/LP/` and `equivariant_hgn/scripts/NC/` directories for  the Link Prediction and Node Classification tasks, respectively. If the option `evaluate=1` is set, then a test set prediction file will be produced for the given dataset. Submission instructions for these test set predictions can be found at https://www.biendata.xyz/hgb
